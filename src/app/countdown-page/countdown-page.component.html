<p>
  There is an API endpoint called /api/deadline which returns secondsLeft: number JSON object containing the number of
  seconds left to some constant deadline date (deadline date never changes). Write an Angular component (and any other
  Angular classes/functions if needed) that will retrieve data from backend and will display “Seconds left to deadline:
  X” countdown timer (X should be updated every second). Please take your time to write performance optimized code that
  could be then copy-pasted into some bigger Angular project.

<app-countdown-timer [secondsLeft]="initialSecondsLeft"></app-countdown-timer>
